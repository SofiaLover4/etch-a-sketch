//First Thoughts//

Here I go into the next project from TOP, I am so close to being done with the foundations course although I feel the calculator project will take me a while. Anyways, I am going into this project looking to better my commit messaging skills(I don't even know if thats the right term). TOP said this project was going to requiring googling as well so let's hope that googling skills are good enough for this. Here I go!
