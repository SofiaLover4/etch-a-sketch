# etch-a-sketch

//First Thoughts//

Here I go into the next project from TOP, I am so close to being done with the foundations course although I feel the calculator project will take me a while. Anyways, I am going into this project looking to better my commit messaging skills(I don't even know if thats the right term). TOP said this project was going to requiring googling as well so let's hope that googling skills are good enough for this. Here I go!

//Final Thoughts//

I feel like code still came out pretty messy. Also I just could not figure out how to make the colors 10% more black. I tried using google to no success. Everything else went well though. I could add and more and make it look more pretty but at the same time I want to move onto the next section and see what I can learn there. If there comes any useful info for solving my problem later on I will comeback to this project(if I don't forget). Until then, goodbye etch-a-sketch, it was a pleasure creating you.
